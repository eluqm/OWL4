The below is what has been changed since AIM version 2 revision 15. 

1. Remove "isPresent" attribute from AnatomicEntityCharacteristic and ImagingObservationCharacteristic.

2. Remove Rating class.

3. Add the following class to replace Rating with enhanced information capturing
   - CharacteristicQuantification (an abstract class) is the parent of the following classes:
     - Interval class
     - Numerical class
     - Quantile class
     - Scale class 
     - NonQuantifiable class

4. Remove "segmentationType" from Segmentation class since SOPClassUID represents the same information.

5. Add "precedentReferencedAnnotationUID" to Annotation class. It is a Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) (style) 
    unique identifier for referencing earlier instance of AIM annotation. 

6. Add algorithmName and algorithmVersion in Calculation class for algorithm identification.

7. Add AIMStatus class. It is used to capture a status of an annotation instance using coded term, a version of annotation 
        instance and update authorization (authorizedBy).

8. Remove SegmentationType in value domain (caDSR Value Domain)

9. Add an association between ImagingObservation and ReferencedGeometricShape

10. Add PresentationState class for DICOM Presentation State

11. Add label attribute to AnatomicEntity, AnatomicEntityCharacteristic, ImagingObservation, ImagingObservationCharacteristic
